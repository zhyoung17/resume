			<div class="content">
				<p>With experience in both <strong>print</strong> and <strong>data journalism</strong>, I strive to make
					a direct impact to the lives around me through my work. In this data driven
					world, I believe that we need to rely on data to make rational decision, and this will be translated
					through my news articles.</p>

					<strong>HTML</strong>, with this website serving as a testament to my skill.

					<h3>Husband and Wives Income</h3>
					<div class="content">
						<p>Worked with a team of data visualisation developers and illustrators to produce my piece on

						</p>
						<p>My team and I analysed 3 sets of data comparing husband and wives' income. Following which,
							we
							conceptualised creative visualisation ideas, such as allowing readers to guess the spouse's
							income.</p>
						<p>I am proud to share that this piece was one of the <strong>most read interactive news pieces

					<h3>Analysing Shanti Pereira</h3>
					<div class="content">
						<p>I've also dabbled with sports analytics, and analysed data provided by the coaching team of

				<h2>Print Journalism</h2>
				<div class="content">
					<p>On top of data analysis and digital journalism, I have also exhibited competency in
						<strong>writing</strong> and <strong>producing</strong> my own news articles. During my time
						at
						the Singapore
						newsdesk, I covered a wide range of social affairs in Singapore, including passport
						collection,
						the
						chicken shortage, multiple fire incidents.
					</p>
					<p>My self-pitch, data-centric piece about the increasing maximum temperature in Singapore was
						chosen to
						be <strong>The Big Story</strong> on ST. It was chosen to be on <strong>page A3</strong> and
						was
						selected as the <strong>editor's pick</strong> that day.</p>
